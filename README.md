# React TypeScript Project - README

Welcome to the **ThinkW Practical Task** project, a React application bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and utilizing TypeScript. This project serves as a practical example of building a web application using the React framework with TypeScript.

## Getting Started

To begin with this project, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory using your terminal.

### Installation

Before you start, make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed.

Run the following command to install the required packages:

```bash
npm install
```

### Running the Application

You can launch the application in development mode by running:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the development server and open the application in your default web browser. You can access it at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following scripts:

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode. Check the [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) documentation for more details.

### `npm run build`

Builds the application for production to the `build` folder. This optimizes the build for the best performance. Check the [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) documentation for deployment information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**

If you wish to customize build tools and configurations, you can `eject` at any time. This will give you full control over dependencies and configuration files.
